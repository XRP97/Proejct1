# Project Description
For this mini-project, you need to find at least one partner to make a team of 2-3 people.  
In this group, you need to create a single repository and elect one person to merge pull requests as the team leader.  
You must have at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature".  Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  
Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".  

#Commit message Examples:
Feature:  Added definition of the term repository.

Fix: Updated definition of repository

Task: Uploaded an image screenshot for a repository

#Project Details

For this project, you need to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.  
Your group also needs to have 2-3 (depending on group size) sections about the following topics:  

You must explain the gitFlow (Links to an external site.) workflow and have a section to define and give examples of how to use the following Git commands and terminology:

Repository
Clone
Fork
Branch
Commit
Merge
Checkout
Push
Pull 
Remote Add / Remove / Show
Status
Master Branch

Create a step-by-step tutorial that explains how to set up Git and work collaboratively with more than one person.  
You must explain the concept of branching and how to use branches to avoid merge conflicts, your tutorial must illustrate how to create a merge conflict and resolve the merge conflict.   

1. Forking vs Cloning

2. Pull Request

3. Adding a collaborator to a Github Repo.

#Formatting and style:

1.  Use separate pages as necessary, don't mix the sections up, use one or more pages.

2.  The Readme file should show your group member's name

3.  The Readme file should be an index to your other pages and link to them.

4.  Use markdown (Links to an external site.) to style the pages nicely with headings, bullet points, multiple pages linked together and pictures.

5.  Put a "Changelog" on your readme files that you list all the changes to the document and who did them. 

6.  Put a section of sources with links to tutorials and feel free to link to other documents in your work.

To complete the assignment, your group needs to submit a link to a Github repository.
